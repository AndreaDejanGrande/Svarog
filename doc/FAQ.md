# FAQ

## Why is my hashrate so low?

`Svarog` is a CPU miner for the vCrypt protocol/algorithm
(e.g. vDinar), which also means it relies on low intensity.
Even though vCrypt is ASIC resistant, you can still mine it
with a GPU, obtaining a much higher hashrate depending on
your card. If you'd like to mine vCrypt (vDinar) with your
GPU, read next step!

## Can I mine vCrypt (vDinar) with my GPU?

`Svarog` is CPU only, but you can download other miners to
support your GPU! Nearly any GPU manufactured today is
either produced by AMD or Nvidia, depending on what device
you're running you can choose between these two miners:

**Triglav** (for AMD): https://github.com/AndreaDejanGrande/Triglav.git
**Veles** (for Nvidia): https://github.com/AndreaDejanGrande/Veles.git
